# Scraping with Scrapy
This project demonstrates web scraping using the Scrapy framework. It includes two scripts: one to scrape data from "therugshopuk.co.uk" and another to scrape items from "www.coingecko.com". The project showcases the capabilities of Scrapy for extracting data from websites efficiently.

## Features
- Scrape Product Data: Extract product information from "therugshopuk.co.uk".
- Scrape Cryptocurrency Data: Extract cryptocurrency data from "www.coingecko.com".
- Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
- Extensible and Scalable: Built with Scrapy, making it easy to extend and scale for other websites.




## To run the code on your machine:
  - ### Install the dependencies
  - ### Then just run the files as a python file since we have worked with the `scrapy.CrawlerProcess`
  ```
  python allrugs.py
  ```
  or for the second file:
  ```
  python crypto.py
  ```

#### And here we go!
